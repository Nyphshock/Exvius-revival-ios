"""Optionally ask the game to upload its own error log.

The client keeps a report log (`Reports`, the "REPORTSMODULE"): among other things, a failed table load
writes `Error loading MST INFO=<details>` to it (LoginScene::procStateMstLoadWait and
procStateTextMstLoadWait). The live servers could ask for that log with a "report back" group in any
reply; the client's report scheduler (`Reports::update`) then uploads it with `sgStoreLogReportRequest`
and waits for a "report state" group in the answer. Read from the Android 9.0 library:

  report back   group 383e98ad (sgReportBackResponse)
                  86f76840  send-after time, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" UTC (CommonUtils::convertToTime);
                            "0" means "no request"
                  da99ba05  hold flag; "0" lets the upload go ahead
  store log     request sgStoreLogReportRequest, /actionSymbol/6611dc2f.php, key af7a56a0
  report state  group cd87bd8b (sgReportStateResponse), 950510b8 = 0 for success

This matters for a stock client such as the iPhone app, whose own system log is redacted: its reports
are the only place the client says what went wrong. Collection is off by default; turn on
EXVIUS_CLIENT_REPORTS=1 to save uploads under <server data>/client-reports/. Pending uploads are
acknowledged and discarded while collection is off.

OFF BY DEFAULT since 2026-11-10. The request used to ride on every RoutineHomeUpdateRequest reply too, which the
game sends about every 15 seconds, and the game then uploaded its whole log each time (a player measured about
22 MB every 15 seconds, public repo PR #2), so loading was slow. Off, the server asks for nothing; an upload
the game already has queued is still answered (report state 0) so it doesn't retry, but not saved, and the
server prints one line with its size. The per-request records (capture_server) never keep a report's body.
On, the request goes out once per launch, on the GameSettingRequest reply only (operator, 2026-11-10).
