"""Ask the game to upload its own error log, and keep what it sends.

The client keeps a report log (`Reports`, the "REPORTSMODULE"): among other things, a failed table load
writes `Error loading MST INFO=<details>` to it (LoginScene::procStateMstLoadWait and
procStateTextMstLoadWait). The live servers could ask for that log with a "report back" group in any
reply; the client's report scheduler (`Reports::update`) then uploads it with `sgStoreLogReportRequest`
and waits for a "report state" group in the answer. Read from the Android 9.0 library:

  report back   group 383e98ad (sgReportBackResponse)
                  86f76840  send-after time, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" UTC (CommonUtils::convertToTime);
                            "0" means "no request"
                  da99ba05  hold flag; "0" lets the upload go ahead
  store log     request sgStoreLogReportRequest, /actionSymbol/6611dc2f.php, key af7a56a0
  report state  group cd87bd8b (sgReportStateResponse), 950510b8 = 0 for success

This matters for a stock client such as the iPhone app, whose own system log is redacted: its reports
are the only place the client says what went wrong. Turned on with EXVIUS_CLIENT_REPORTS=1; each upload
is saved under <server data>/client-reports/.
